# FS Live Traffic Liveries

This repository serves the aircraft models and liveries for the FSLTL product. To install FSLTL and the Injector, please use the [FlyByWire (FBW) Installer](https://flybywiresim.com)

## Installing FSLTL

1. To install FSLTL, download and run the FBW Installer.
1. Once the FBW Installer opens, in the left pane, click on the radar icon (3rd icon from the top). This will bring you to the FSLTL menu where you will see two separate options for FSLTL, Traffic Base Models and the FSLTL Traffic Injector.
1. To install the FSLTL Traffic Injector (main application that runs the FSLTL add-on), click on FSLTL Traffic Injector and click Install in the bottom right of the FBW Installer window.
1. On the Package Size prompt that opens, ensure you have the necessary free space and then click Install.
1. Once the installer completes the FSLTL Traffic Injector installation, you will see the Installed button become unclickable and an Uninstall button appears.
1. To install FSLTL Traffic Base Models, repeat the same process.

## Recommended MSFS Traffic Settings
The FSLTL Injector can run alongside MSFS traffic but to ensure the best experience we recommend the following MSFS settings to avoid conflict and overlap.

- Flight Conditions
    - Air Traffic set to "off"
- General Options / Traffic tab
    - Aircraft Traffic type set to "off"
    - Ground Aircraft Density set to "0"
